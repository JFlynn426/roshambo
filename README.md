This project was the weekend project for our first week of javascript. This project shows how I was able to program the logic of rock-paper-scissors after just being introduced to javascript. I was able to correctly program the winning logic for rock-paper-scissors and check for user input after only a short time of being introduced to javascript in class. Adding event listeners to check for user input was new to me at the time and although typically I will use state managment for updating the DOM in react currently, I was able to use vanilla javascript to create a working rock-paper-scissors game.
